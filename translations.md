If you want to translate or remix my work in any way, you are free to do so, as
long as you comply with the [terms of the license][license]. Feel free to reach
out to me if you have any questions or are working on a translation. I will
gladly link to it in the original article.

How to go about doing translations:

1. [Read the license][license]
2. Choose what you want to translate
3. Translate it
4. Host your translation somewhere[^hosting]
5. [Notify me][contact]

[^hosting]: You can use Medium, or [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), or Wordpress, or Blogger, or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), or [Telegra.ph](https://telegra.ph/), or [Write.as](https://write.as/), or one of the thousands of publishing solutions that surely exist. You can also just host a txt file on your web server or something.
