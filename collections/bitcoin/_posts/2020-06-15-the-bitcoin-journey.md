A couple of weeks ago I had the immense pleasure of giving the opening
talk at the *Value of Bitcoin* conference. I would like to revisit some
ideas of this talk and maybe dig deeper into some parts. After all, my
keynote [*The Bitcoin Journey*](https://youtu.be/qVuFX0LkNDQ) was
restrained by time: 21 minutes.

Again, I will look at the Bitcoin journey in two parts:

1.  The journey of a bitcoiner
2.  The journey of Bitcoin

### Part 1: The Journey of a Bitcoiner

The natural reaction upon encountering Bitcoin for the first time is to
dismiss it. Most people reject the idea that Magic Internet Money could
work, or could be interesting, or could fix any woes that society might
have. Outright dismissal was my first reaction as well: "Oh, this will
never really work. It will get hacked one day and all your funny
internet money will be gone." Alas, at least I can find comfort in the
fact that I'm not alone with my initial reaction. While some bitcoiners
understood the gravity of the situation immediately, most of us mere
mortals had to be confronted with Bitcoin multiple times before we took
a closer look.

In short, the journey of a bitcoiner usually goes like this:

1.  This will never work.
2.  Why isn't it dead yet?
3.  Oh, this is interesting ...
4.  🕳️ 🐇
5.  ⬇️
6.  🤯

Falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole can feel a little bit like being
stuck in an M.C. Escher painting. Up is down, down is up, a lot of
things don't make sense at first, and the longer you look at it the more
confusing it gets. However, there is some order to this chaos. It's just
not apparent at first.

{% include image.html name="mc-escher-relativity.jpg" %}

The reason for this initial confusion is, I believe, twofold. First,
Bitcoin is extremely interdisciplinary. It spans a lot of topics, even
if you just want to get a rudimentary understanding of it. You will
probably have to learn some cryptography (at least what the difference
between a public key and a private key is), some computer science (how
does a decentralized network differ from other computer systems), some
trading (where can I buy bitcoin and why does it have the price it
currently has), and some game theory (who controls Bitcoin and why is it
so hard to change or shut down) just to get started. Curiously, the
deeper you dig, the more disciplines will pop up: macroeconomics,
scalability, elliptic curve cryptography, monetary policy, the history
of money, the measure and study of scarcity, smart contracts,
programming and scripting languages, incentive structures, laws,
regulations, privacy, security, psychology, even biology. The list of
topics is practically endless.

This idea is quite beautifully illustrated by what I would call The
Bitcoin Flower ([Unchained
Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/blog/blockchain-spectrum/), 2017)
and The Bitcoin Learning Spiral ([Block
Tower](https://thecryptocurrencyinvestor.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/bt-educationpdf.pdf),
Ari Paul, 2018).

The downside of this multidisciplinary nature is that understanding
Bitcoin doesn't come easy. The upside is that many roads might lead you
to take a closer look at Bitcoin. In other words: many entries lead down
this particular rabbit hole. Whether you have a background in computer
science, finance, trading, cryptography, physics, economics, are a gold
bug, a classical liberal, or have flirted with the idea of
cryptoanarchy. All these backgrounds can give you a head-start.

What is interesting, though, is that so many people from so many
different backgrounds arrive at the same conclusion: bitcoin is the
money of the future. While the rabbit hole has many entries, in the end,
all roads lead to Bitcoin.

### Part 2: The Journey of Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a zero-to-one invention. Before Satoshi invented Bitcoin,
real digital scarcity did not exist; the double-spending problem was
unsolved. Today, we live in a world where Bitcoin exists. More
importantly, we live in a world where bitcoin has value.

Thus, we can identify three stages:

-   Stage 0: Bitcoin does not exist.
-   Stage n: Bitcoin exists.
-   Stage N: bitcoin has value.

{% include image.html name="015.png" %}

Stage N is important because Bitcoin's underlying NgU technology
requires that bitcoin has some value. Once it acquires value --- any
value --- Bitcoin's eternal feedback loop kicks in.

{% include image.html name="017.png" %}

Satoshi alluded to this feedback loop in his writings.

> It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough
> people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy."
> --- [Satoshi
> Nakamoto](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/17/)

Over the last couple of years all kinds of people ---
[artists](https://hodlr.rocks/satoshi-series/satoshi-rides-the-waves-of-change-series-of-10/),
researchers, quants, traders, commentators, in short: bitcoiners from
all walks of life --- noticed that Bitcoin seems to come in waves. In
2018, Hasu and Nic Carter published [Visions of
Bitcoin](http://fakehost/@nic__carter/visions-of-bitcoin-4b7b7cbcd24c),
describing the various competing narratives that were used to describe
Bitcoin up to this point: e-cash proof of concept, censorship-resistant
e-gold, cheap payments network, programmable shared database, anonymous
darknet currency, reserve currency for crypto, and finally: an
uncorrelated financial asset.

More recently, Plan B published his [Stock-to-Flow Cross Asset
Model](http://fakehost/@100trillionUSD/bitcoin-stock-to-flow-cross-asset-model-50d260feed12)
(S2FX) which identifies distinct clusters by looking at the
stock-to-flow and market value of bitcoin. He identified four distinct
clusters:

1.  Proof of Concept
2.  Payments
3.  E-Gold
4.  Financial Asset

{% include image.html name="021.png" %}

If the model holds, we are about to enter Phase 5. How Bitcoin will
manifest in this phase will be known only in hindsight.

Another analysis regarding the wavy nature of Bitcoin was done by
Unchained Capital, first published in 2018. Their [HODL
Waves](https://unchained-capital.com/hodlwaves/) beautifully show the
age distribution of the Bitcoin UTXO set. In essence, we can see that a
certain percentage of people choose to hold bitcoin for the long term,
i.e. for several years. They identified various HODL waves just by
looking at the UTXO age: the Genesis HODL, the HODL of 2011, and the
HODL of 2014. By looking at the most recent data we can also identify a
HODL of 2018.

{% include image.html name="026.png" %}

The most entertaining analysis is [this
video](https://youtu.be/XbZ8zDpX2Mg) by Alex Millar, published in 2015.
He is looking purely on price, showing how bitcoin tends to accrue value
in a massive run-up, only to crash down hard a short time later.
However, the price floor after the crash is usually way higher than the
previous low, resulting in an upwards trend in the long run.

These various phases and waves show that Bitcoin has a cyclical nature.
We already saw how demand, price, and security form an eternal feedback
loop. However, many different aspects of Bitcoin are cyclical. Adoption,
development, mining, difficulty adjustments, reward eras --- all of them
are cyclical. Granted, the halvings will stop in about 120 years, but
the other cycles will most likely continue.

### Part 3: Coming Full Circle

The essence of Bitcoin, the one thing that is truly unchanging, is the
output of the system: the UTXO set. Nodes work together to constantly
append it, verifying blocks and transactions, adding what is valid and
discarding what is invalid. The chain tip is the shared understanding of
all nodes: the version of the ledger which is most accurate and
up-to-date.

Similarly, people are building a shared corpus of knowledge and mental
models trying to figure out what Bitcoin is. Bitcoiners work together to
constantly add to the knowledge, incorporating what is valid and
meaningful, discarding what is invalid or doesn't make sense. Our shared
understanding of Bitcoin can be seen as a Schelling Point: the
conclusion that most people arrived at after intense study, often
without indoctrination or communication with others.

{% include image.html name="041.png" %}

A Bitcoin node doesn't trust what others are saying: it verifies all
data as best as it can. Similarly, most bitcoiners don't trust what
others are saying: they verify narratives and mental models as best as
they can.

Just like Bitcoin is a game without an end, falling down the Bitcoin
rabbit hole is a journey without an end. Bitcoin is an ever-changing,
organic system. It will evolve, as will our individual and collective
understanding of it. In other words: I believe that the reason why
no-one has found the bottom of the rabbit hole yet is that there is no
bottom. The rabbit hole is circular. In the coming years and decades,
many people will try to fully understand what Bitcoin is and what it
might become. But try as we might, I'm afraid a complete understanding
will never be gained. We will all have to find our peace with this alien
technology, or we are bound to walk in paradoxical circles around it in
our quest to full comprehension.

{% include image.html name="045.png" %}

In the end, if Bitcoin continues to be successful, it is bound to
disappear. Just like the internet and electricity before it, it will
move to the background, like running water in your home or the air you
breathe. Everyone will take Bitcoin for granted. Consequently,
bitcoiners will disappear. Just like today, you don't have to identify
as an "internet person" anymore, in the future, you won't have to
identify as a bitcoiner anymore. When this day comes, we will have
entered the final stage.

Stage O: Bitcoin is Omnipresent.
