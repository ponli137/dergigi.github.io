I have a drinking bottle that I got a couple of years ago. I believe my sister
gave it to me. It simply says: "What if you're right, and they are wrong?"

Being right isn't always a good thing. Sometimes you wish to be wrong. I
certainly wish to be wrong on some things that I believe are in store for all of
us, because these things will neither be easy nor pretty.

The good thing about trying to be right or wrong about the future is that the
future isn't set in stone. Sometimes even the past isn't - at least it seems
that way. We should rejoice in the fact that we can make things right, right
now. We can right our previous wrongs and try to do the right thing right now so
that the future will steer itself in the right direction.

It is important to remind yourself that you might be wrong. Humility is the
foundation of all virtues, they say. Even Confucius reminds us that "to
acknowledge our incapacity is the way to be soon prepared to teach others; for
from the moment that a man is no longer full of himself, nor puffed up with
empty pride, whatever good he learns in the morning he practices before night."
