There is creation, and there is death. I realize more and more that if I'm not creating, I'm dying. Slowly. On the inside. But, for whatever reason, it is still almost impossible for me to create as much as I would love to. I don't know why. Maybe because it's hard.

Consumption is easy. Creation is not. I want to be active, not reactive. I want to produce, not consume. So here is my pledge for this year, and the next, and all the years after that. Create. At all costs. No more excuses. No more shallowness. No more putting it off. Less input. More output.

I love photography. I love writing. I enjoy building things. I will do it all. There is creation, and there is death.
