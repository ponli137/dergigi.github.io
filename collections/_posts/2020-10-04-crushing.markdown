Like crashing waves along the shore, life's challenges - big and small - don't
come isolated, and once a big one hits, you can be sure that another one -
equally big, or even bigger - will hit just moments later.

If you're not careful, the waves will crush you underneath their might,
swallowing you whole, leaving you no room to breathe. I am writing these lines
as I'm gasping for air, struggling to stay afloat in the waters of an unfamiliar
shore. It's a good kind of struggle, the one that makes you a better swimmer -
if you survive.

To smash, shatter, break into fragments; force down, and bruise by heavy weight.
To overpower and subdue, to gnash teeth, crash, smash, break. All of that and
more is crushing, yet having a crush is usually the opposite. Or is it?

Resistance. Ego. The opposite of joy and peace.

In the grand scheme of things, my sorrows are just a drop of water. And yet, in
my weakest moments, this drop, this vapor of an intangible substance, feels
crushing.
